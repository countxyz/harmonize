  # Dashing come with default widgets using css and coffeescript.
  # You can create your own widgets by adding the following files:
  #
  # A widget is composed of:
  # - an HTML file used for layout and bindings                                     - app/views/dashing/widgets/foo.html
  # - a SCSS file for styles                                                        - app/assets/stylesheets/dashing/widgets/foo.scss
  # - a coffeescript file which allows you to handle incoming data & functionality  - app/assets/javascripts/dashing/widgets/foo.coffee
  #
  # CSS and JS file will be added to the asset path and the asset pipeline automatically.
  #
